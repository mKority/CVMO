          <h3>Supply Chain Management</h3>
          <p>After my master degree in SCM my Journey started at Arvato SCM Solutions working as the assistant to the
              Hamburg warehouse director. This position incorporated all possible to-dos in warehouse logistics ranging
              from key account management to project management, controlling and setting up new processes in the warehouse.</p>

          <h3>Innovation & Business Development</h3>
          <p>After two great years I felt the urge to further develop myself. As a product
              owner at OBI I have been responsible for the CREATE! Store - a test lab for new innovative DIY products -
              in Cologne. Including managing store staff, setting up a
              production process, deciding which new products to
              develop and which products to bring to the OBI markets. Additionally I have been working to improve
              the care-calendar feature in the HeyOBI App.</p>

          <h3>Carnival Song Fluency</h3>
          <p>Maybe one of my proudest achievements. Even though not born in Cologne I love its culture, music and
              carnival and can sing along with basically every "kölsch" carnival song.</p>
